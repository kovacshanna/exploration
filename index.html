          <h4 id="intro">Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            Earth is the only planet in the solar system whose English name does
            not come from Greek or Roman mythology. The name was taken from Old
            English and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." There are, of
            course, many names for our planet in the thousands of languages
            spoken by the people of the third planet from the Sun.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="name">Namesake</h4>
          <p>
            The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets,
            except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and
            goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply
            means “the ground.”
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="life">Potential for Life</h4>
          <p>
            Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that
            have made life abundant here. Most notably, Earth is unique in that
            most of our planet is covered in liquid water, since the temperature
            allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. Earth's
            vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8
            billion years ago.
            <br /><br />
            Some of the features of our planet that make it great for sustaining
            life are changing due to the ongoing effects of climate change.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="size">Size and Distance</h4>
          <p>
            With an equatorial diameter of 7926 miles (12,760 kilometers), Earth
            is the biggest of the terrestrial planets and the fifth largest
            planet in our solar system.
            <br /><br />
            From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million
            kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical unit away from the
            Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the
            distance from the Sun to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to
            quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun.
            <br /><br />
            It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our
            planet.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="orbit">Orbit and Rotation</h4>
          <p>
            As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours.
            It takes 365.25 days to complete one trip around the Sun. That extra
            quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar system, which
            counts one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent
            with our orbit around the Sun, every four years we add one day. That
            day is called a leap day, and the year it's added to is called a
            leap year.
            <br /><br />
            Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the
            plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. This tilt causes our yearly
            cycle of seasons. During part of the year, the northern hemisphere
            is tilted toward the Sun, and the southern hemisphere is tilted
            away. With the Sun higher in the sky, solar heating is greater in
            the north producing summer there. Less direct solar heating produces
            winter in the south. Six months later, the situation is reversed.
            When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres receive roughly equal
            amounts of heat from the Sun.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="moons">Moons</h4>
          <p>
            Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the
            brightest and most familiar object in the night sky. In many ways,
            the Moon is responsible for making Earth such a great home. It
            stabilizes our planet's wobble, which has made the climate less
            variable over thousands of years.
            <br /><br />
            Earth sometimes temporarily hosts orbiting asteroids or large rocks.
            They are typically trapped by Earth's gravity for a few months or
            years before returning to an orbit around the Sun. Some asteroids
            will be in a long “dance” with Earth as both orbit the Sun.
            <br /><br />
            Some moons are bits of rock that were captured by a planet's
            gravity, but our Moon is likely the result of a collision billions
            of years ago. When Earth was a young planet, a large chunk of rock
            smashed into it, displacing a portion of Earth's interior. The
            resulting chunks clumped together and formed our Moon. With a radius
            of 1,080 miles (1,738 kilometers), the Moon is the fifth largest
            moon in our solar system (after Ganymede, Titan, Callisto, and Io).
            <br /><br />
            The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away
            from Earth. That means 30 Earth-sized planets could fit in between
            Earth and its Moon.

          <h4 id="rings">Rings</h4>
          <p>Earth has no rings.</p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="formation">Formation</h4>
          <p>
            When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5
            billion years ago, Earth formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and
            dust in to become the third planet from the Sun. Like its fellow
            terrestrial planets, Earth has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a
            solid crust.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="structure">Structure</h4>
          <p>
            Earth is composed of four main layers, starting with an inner core
            at the planet's center, enveloped by the outer core, mantle, and
            crust.
            <br /><br />
            The inner core is a solid sphere made of iron and nickel metals
            about 759 miles (1,221 kilometers) in radius. There the temperature
            is as high as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit (5,400 degrees Celsius).
            Surrounding the inner core is the outer core. This layer is about
            1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) thick, made of iron and nickel
            fluids.
            <br /><br />
            In between the outer core and crust is the mantle, the thickest
            layer. This hot, viscous mixture of molten rock is about 1,800 miles
            (2,900 kilometers) thick and has the consistency of caramel. The
            outermost layer, Earth's crust, goes about 19 miles (30 kilometers)
            deep on average on land. At the bottom of the ocean, the crust is
            thinner and extends about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the seafloor
            to the top of the mantle.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="surface">Surface</h4>
          <p>
            Like Mars and Venus, Earth has volcanoes, mountains, and valleys.
            Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust (both continental and
            oceanic) and the upper mantle, is divided into huge plates that are
            constantly moving. For example, the North American plate moves west
            over the Pacific Ocean basin, roughly at a rate equal to the growth
            of our fingernails. Earthquakes result when plates grind past one
            another, ride up over one another, collide to make mountains, or
            split and separate.
            <br /><br />
            Earth's global ocean, which covers nearly 70% of the planet's
            surface, has an average depth of about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) and
            contains 97% of Earth's water. Almost all of Earth's volcanoes are
            hidden under these oceans. Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano is taller from
            base to summit than Mount Everest, but most of it is underwater.
            Earth's longest mountain range is also underwater, at the bottom of
            the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. It is four times longer than the
            Andes, Rockies and Himalayas combined.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="atmosphere">Atmosphere</h4>
          <p>
            Near the surface, Earth has an atmosphere that consists of 78%
            nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases such as argon, carbon
            dioxide, and neon. The atmosphere affects Earth's long-term climate
            and short-term local weather and shields us from much of the harmful
            radiation coming from the Sun. It also protects us from meteoroids,
            most of which burn up in the atmosphere, seen as meteors in the
            night sky, before they can strike the surface as meteorites.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="magnetosphere">Magnetosphere</h4>
          <p>
            Our planet's rapid rotation and molten nickel-iron core give rise to
            a magnetic field, which the solar wind distorts into a teardrop
            shape in space. (The solar wind is a stream of charged particles
            continuously ejected from the Sun.) When charged particles from the
            solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic field, they collide
            with air molecules above our planet's magnetic poles. These air
            molecules then begin to glow and cause aurorae, or the northern and
            southern lights.
            <br /><br />
            The magnetic field is what causes compass needles to point to the
            North Pole regardless of which way you turn. But the magnetic
            polarity of Earth can change, flipping the direction of the magnetic
            field. The geologic record tells scientists that a magnetic reversal
            takes place about every 400,000 years on average, but the timing is
            very irregular. As far as we know, such a magnetic reversal doesn't
            cause any harm to life on Earth, and a reversal is very unlikely to
            happen for at least another thousand years. But when it does happen,
            compass needles are likely to point in many different directions for
            a few centuries while the switch is being made. And after the switch
            is completed, they will all point south instead of north.
