          <h4 id="intro">Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and
            it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien
            landscape. NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was
            much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years
            ago.
            <br /><br />
            Mars was named by the Romans for their god of war because its
            reddish color was reminiscent of blood. The Egyptians called it "Her
            Desher," meaning "the red one."
            <br /><br />
            Even today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet" because iron
            minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface
            to look red.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="name">Namesake</h4>
          <p>
            Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because
            its reddish color was reminiscent of blood. Other civilizations also
            named the planet for this attribute - for example, the Egyptians
            called it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one." Even today, it is
            frequently called the "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the
            Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="life">Potential for Life</h4>
          <p>
            Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on
            Mars. Instead, they're looking for signs of life that existed long
            ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="size">Size and Distance</h4>
          <p>
            With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half
            the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be
            about as big as a raspberry.
            <br /><br />
            From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million
            kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. One
            astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun
            to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel
            from the Sun to Mars.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="orbit">Orbit and Rotation</h4>
          <p>
            As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours,
            which is very similar to one day on Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days
            are called sols - short for "solar day." A year on Mars lasts 669.6
            sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.
            <br /><br />
            Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the
            plane of its orbit around the Sun. This is another similarity with
            Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars has
            distinct seasons, but they last longer than seasons here on Earth
            since Mars takes longer to orbit the Sun (because it's farther
            away). And while here on Earth the seasons are evenly spread over
            the year, lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the
            seasons vary in length because of Mars' elliptical, egg-shaped orbit
            around the Sun.
            <br /><br />
            Spring in the northern hemisphere (autumn in the southern) is the
            longest season at 194 sols. Autumn in the northern hemisphere
            (spring in the southern) is the shortest at 142 days. Northern
            winter/southern summer is 154 sols, and northern summer/southern
            winter is 178 sols.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="moons">Moons</h4>
          <p>
            Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured
            asteroids. They're potato-shaped because they have too little mass
            for gravity to make them spherical.
            <br /><br />
            The moons get their names from the horses that pulled the chariot of
            the Greek god of war, Ares.
            <br /><br />
            Phobos, the innermost and larger moon, is heavily cratered, with
            deep grooves on its surface. It is slowly moving towards Mars and
            will crash into the planet or break apart in about 50 million years.
            <br /><br />
            Deimos is about half as big as Phobos and orbits two and a half
            times farther away from Mars. Oddly-shaped Deimos is covered in
            loose dirt that often fills the craters on its surface, making it
            appear smoother than pockmarked Phobos.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="rings">Rings</h4>
          <p>
            Mars has no rings. However, in 50 million years when Phobos crashes
            into Mars or breaks apart, it could create a dusty ring around the
            Red Planet.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="formation">Formation</h4>
          <p>
            When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5
            billion years ago, Mars formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and
            dust in to become the fourth planet from the Sun. Mars is about half
            the size of Earth, and like its fellow terrestrial planets, it has a
            central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="structure">Structure</h4>
          <p>
            Mars has a dense core at its center between 930 and 1,300 miles
            (1,500 to 2,100 kilometers) in radius. It's made of iron, nickel,
            and sulfur. Surrounding the core is a rocky mantle between 770 and
            1,170 miles (1,240 to 1,880 kilometers) thick, and above that, a
            crust made of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium.
            This crust is between 6 and 30 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) deep.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="surface">Surface</h4>
          <p>
            The Red Planet is actually many colors. At the surface, we see
            colors such as brown, gold, and tan. The reason Mars looks reddish
            is due to oxidization - or rusting - of iron in the rocks, regolith
            (Martian “soil”), and dust of Mars. This dust gets kicked up into
            the atmosphere and from a distance makes the planet appear mostly
            red.
            <br /><br />
            Interestingly, while Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, its
            surface has nearly the same area as Earth's dry land. Its volcanoes,
            impact craters, crustal movement, and atmospheric conditions such as
            dust storms have altered the landscape of Mars over many years,
            creating some of the solar system's most interesting topographical
            features.
            <br /><br />
            A large canyon system called Valles Marineris is long enough to
            stretch from California to New York - more than 3,000 miles (4,800
            kilometers). This Martian canyon is 200 miles (320 kilometers) at
            its widest and 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) at its deepest. That's about
            10 times the size of Earth's Grand Canyon.
            <br /><br />
            Mars is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus
            Mons. It's three times taller than Earth's Mt. Everest with a base
            the size of the state of New Mexico.
            <br /><br />
            Mars appears to have had a watery past, with ancient river valley
            networks, deltas, and lakebeds, as well as rocks and minerals on the
            surface that could only have formed in liquid water. Some features
            suggest that Mars experienced huge floods about 3.5 billion years
            ago.
            <br /><br />
            There is water on Mars today, but the Martian atmosphere is too thin
            for liquid water to exist for long on the surface. Today, water on
            Mars is found in the form of water-ice just under the surface in the
            polar regions as well as in briny (salty) water, which seasonally
            flows down some hillsides and crater walls.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="atmosphere">Atmosphere</h4>
          <p>
            Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide,
            nitrogen, and argon gases. To our eyes, the sky would be hazy and
            red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we
            see on Earth. Mars' sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection
            from impacts by such objects as meteorites, asteroids, and comets.
            <br /><br />
            The temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20
            degrees Celsius) or as low as about -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153
            degrees Celsius). And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from
            the Sun easily escapes this planet. If you were to stand on the
            surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like spring at
            your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter
            at your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius).
            <br /><br />
            Occasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms
            that cover much of the planet. After such storms, it can be months
            before all of the dust settles.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 id="magnetosphere">Magnetosphere</h4>
          <p>
            Mars has no global magnetic field today, but areas of the Martian
            crust in the southern hemisphere are highly magnetized, indicating
            traces of a magnetic field from 4 billion years ago.
