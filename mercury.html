              Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Its surface is
              covered in tens of thousands of impact craters. Despite its
              proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our
              solar system - that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its
              dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping
              around the Sun every 88 Earth days. Mercury is appropriately named
              for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.
