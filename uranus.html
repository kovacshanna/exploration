              Uranus is a very cold and windy planet. It is surrounded by faint rings, and more than two dozen small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side. Uranus is blue-green in color due to large amounts of methane, which absorbs red light but allows blues to be reflected back into space.
